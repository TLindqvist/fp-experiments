# fp-experiments

I learn by doing and writing. This is repository is all about learning more about my trade and functional programming in particular.

## Good to know

- If you read this, please give me feedback.
- I will most likely use several languages to try stuff and and make examples. I think primarily F# and Elm will be used since I like these languages a lot.
- Some examples will be written in a REPL and it should be easy to recreate them if you for some reason would like to do that.
- One of the things I beleive in is composition and I will use this by writing small chapters and trying to compose them inte something bigger
